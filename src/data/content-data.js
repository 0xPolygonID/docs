This is achieved using nullifier techniques that assure that an identity (human being) can undertake an action only once. This becomes a key feature for specific use cases such as voting processes.<li>non-reusable proofs: guaranteeing the verifier that the proof presented by the user was not a copy of a proof generated by another identity, and allowing the verifier to check its validity.</li><li>protection against digital footprint tracking.</ul></ul>",

In the Selective Disclosure mode, the user can also select which information inside the credential he wants to share (without having to select the whole credential). While sharing this information, he also sends a proof about this information so the Verifier can check its correctness.</li><li>Verification of computation:  zero-knowledge proofs can be used to prove that a computation has been performed correctly without the Verifier having to recompute it. For example, within Polygon ID, it is used to prove that an identity is performing a state transition correctly.</li></ol>",

In the future, additional uses of blockchain will be built for Privado ID, such as to enable revocation of credentials, where the Issuer publishes the revocation tree on-chain so the user (Identity Holder) can include the revocation (or non-revocation) information inside the zero-knowledge proof they send to the Verifier.</li></ol>",
