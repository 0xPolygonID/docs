The Credential Wallet lets a user fetch credentials from the [Issuer](../../../../issuer/issuer-overview.md) and save these credentials to his/her wallet. These credentials are later used to prove his/her identification to a [Verifier](../../../../verifier/verifier-overview.md).

Once the credentials have been fetched and stored, a user can later retrieve them from the database, update them, or delete them altogether. The credentials have unique IDs that let a user access them seamlessly.
