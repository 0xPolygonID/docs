## Mobile SDK

1. https://github.com/optimismID/optimismid-flutter-sdk/releases/tag/v2.2.8%2B1
2. https://github.com/optimismID/optimismid-flutter-sdk/releases/tag/v2.2.8%2B2

## Issuer Node [https://github.com/optimismID/issuer-node/releases/tag/v2.3.0](https://github.com/optimismID/issuer-node/releases/tag/v2.3.0)

### Major updates

- Add support for [Ethereum Identities](https://optimismid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PI/pages/78675969/guide+Ethereum+based+identity)
- Enables RHS
- Enables on-chain revocation status
- [Support Non Merklized credentials](https://optimismid.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PI/pages/62783502/Core+Support+of+Non-merklized+credentials)
  - NMC allows to save on a gas cost since NMC require less constrains. This become more crucial for onchain issuer that is more sensitive the the amount of gas since in smart contract use such technique as batching for gas optimization would lead to increasing of trust assumption.

### Minor updates

- Updated protocol libraries
- Fix vulnerabilities of third party libraries
- Make the version non mandatory when importing an schema
- New Vault configuration:
  - The DID is now stored in the vault
  - Vault token renewed
