This tutorial is a quick demonstration of some of Privado ID's main functionalities. To illustrate how Privado ID works, we will walk you through some of its products and tools by following along a simple POAP use case.
POAP stands for Proof of Attendance Protocol, which is used to prove that someone has taken part in a given event.

This guide will briefly touch on the 3 roles of the [Triangle of Trust](introduction.md#core-concepts-of-privado-id-verifiable-credentials-identity-holder-issuer-and-verifier), namely the Identity Holder, the Issuer, and the Verifier. For that, we will take the case of an individual who needs to prove that they were able to participate in a particular event.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. [Set up a Privado ID wallet](#set-up-a-privado-id-wallet)
2. [Issue the POAP credential](#issue-the-poap-credential)
3. [Fetch the newly created credential](#fetch-the-newly-created-credential)
4. [Verify the ID holder credential](#verify-the-id-holder-credential)

## Set up a Privado ID wallet

To store verifiable credentials, the Identity Holder (the individual receiving the credential) needs a compatible wallet. Here, weâ€™ll use the Privado ID Wallet, which supports both mobile and web-based access.

:::note

You may use any Privado ID compatible wallet. See our [<ins>Ecosystem page</ins>](https://marketplace.privado.id/ecosystem) for other options.

:::

To get started with the Privado ID Wallet, you either visit the [Privado ID Web Wallet](https://wallet.privado.id/) in your browser or download the Mobile App and create an Identity.

## Issue the POAP credential

You will now take the role of an Issuer, in this example, the private institution/trusted entity that held the event and creates a POAP. The Issuer is responsible for both creating the credential and sending it to the ID Holder.

We will use <a href="https://issuer-demo.privado.id/">the Issuer Node UI Demo environment</a> to manage credentials. This environment enables an Issuer to create and manage identities and credentials, generate connections, and manage schemas.

:::note

When an Issuer releases a new credential type, they create a schema for that credential. This takes the form of a JSON dataset that gathers all the attributes of that specific credential.

[<ins>Learn how to set up your own Issuer environment by deploying an Issuer node</ins>](/docs/issuer/issuer-overview.md).

:::

To simplify this demo issuance, we provide an existing credential schema with schema type POAP01:

<TabItem value="JSON schema URL">

```ipfs://QmTSwnuCB9grYMB2z5EKXDagfChurK5MiMCS6efrRbsyVX```

> View this credential's data using an <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTSwnuCB9grYMB2z5EKXDagfChurK5MiMCS6efrRbsyVX" target="_blank">online gateway</a>.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="JSON-LD Context URL">

```ipfs://QmdH1Vu79p2NcZLFbHxzJnLuUHJiMZnBeT7SNpLaqK7k9X```

> View this credential's data using an <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdH1Vu79p2NcZLFbHxzJnLuUHJiMZnBeT7SNpLaqK7k9X" target="_blank">online gateway</a>.


</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

The schema used in this demo was built using the Privado ID Schema Builder and is available on [<ins>the Privado ID Schema Explorer</ins>](https://tools.privado.id/schemas/1fa99457-b2ae-4884-ae12-d658bd6abf69). Learn more about creating new schemas on [<ins>the Schema Builder UI guide</ins>](/docs/issuer/schema-builder/).

:::

### Generate the credential

With the new schema in hand, the Issuer can generate a credential.

1. Navigate to <a href="https://issuer-demo.privado.id/">the Issuer Node UI testing environment</a>.

   :::warning

   Only use this publicly available Issuer Node for testing purposes. Do not submit personal or sensitive data. All data is deleted every 48 hours.

   :::

2. Next, import the schema. 

    2.1 Click on **Import Schema** and paste the schema's IPFS address `ipfs://QmTSwnuCB9grYMB2z5EKXDagfChurK5MiMCS6efrRbsyVX`:

       <div align="center">
           <img width="100%" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/import-schema.png")}></img>
       </div>

    2.2 Preview the schema and then Import it.

3. Next, click on **Issue Credential** in the top right-hand corner. Choose **Credential Link** on the next page and your schema on the dropdown menu ("POAP01", in our case). For this credential, we are providing a proof of attendance at an event in Paris:

<div align="center">
    <img width="500" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/create-credential.png")}></img>
</div>

4. Click on **Create Credential Link** to be presented with links and a QR code configured for these links to claim the credential.

    :::info

    Two link types are created, one for the Web App and another for the Mobile App:
    - Deep Link supports the Mobile Wallet App only
    - The [<ins>Universal Link</ins>](/docs/wallet/universal-links.md) supports the Web App only
    
    The QR code can be scanned directly with the Privado ID Wallet app, that is, the Mobile App.

    :::

    <div align="center">
    <img width="500" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/qr.png")}></img>
    </div>

## Fetch the newly created credential

Next, you will take the second role in this tutorial: the ID Holder. You can either use the Web Wallet in the browser or the Mobile Wallet App to accept the credential via the link or the QR code generated by the Issuer in the previous step.

:::note

To sync the identity and its associated credentials between the Privado ID Web Wallet and the Privado ID Wallet App, the user must log in with the same crypto wallet account on both platforms. Once you claim a credential on one platform, it will be visible on the other.

:::

#### Web Wallet

After clicking the Universal link, it will take you to the Web Wallet. Click **Sign In** and connect your crypto wallet such as MetaMask. Click **Add to my wallet**. This should add the credential to your wallet.


<div align="center">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/web-wallet.png")}></img>
</div>

Click on **Manage your credentials** to view and manage the credential in the Web Wallet.

<div align="center">
    <img  src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/web-wallet-2.png")}></img>
</div>

#### Mobile Wallet App

Alternatively, Scan the QR code from the Wallet App. Click **Sign In**. This should authenticate and add the credential to the Wallet.

<div align="center">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/wallet-app.png")}></img>
</div>


## Verify the ID holder credential

Next, you will take the third role in this tutorial: the Verifier. This might be an organization that needs to verify some details of someone's credentials. In our use case, this organization wants to verify whether the ID holder actually attended our made-up Paris event.

Here are the steps to verify the credential:

1. Visit the [Query Builder website](https://tools.privado.id/query-builder/). The [Query Builder](/docs/verifier/query-builder/) is a tool designed to simplify the creation of verification queries.

<div align="center">
    <img width="600" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/verifier-home.png")}></img>
</div>

2. Define the query. We will use the existing JSON-LD URL: `ipfs://QmdH1Vu79p2NcZLFbHxzJnLuUHJiMZnBeT7SNpLaqK7k9X`. The query should look like this:

<div align="center">
    <img width="600" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/verifier-query-1.png")}></img>
</div>

3. Click **Create Query**. Now click **Test query** button which will take you to the Privado ID Web Wallet:

<div align="center">
    <img width="600" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/verifier-query-2.png")}></img>
</div>

4. Click **Sign in** and connect your crypto wallet. As you have already claimed the credential, it shows as 'claimed'. Click **Verify**, after which the process of generating the proof starts.

<div align="center">
    <img width="900" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/web-wallet-verification.png")}></img>
</div>

5. Finally, the proof is generated and sent to the Verifier. The Verifier will then check the revocation status and any additional information to validate the proof. You will receive the following response on the Query Builder website:
<div align="center">
    <img width="600" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/verifier-validation.png")}></img>
</div>

Alternatively, you can also use the Privado ID Wallet app to verify.
After Step 3, once you are redirected to Web Wallet, click on **Continue via app**,
this should present a QR code. Open the Privado ID Wallet App and scan the QR code.
Click on **Verify**
<div align="center">
    <img width="900" src={useBaseUrl("img/quick-start-demo/wallet-app-verification.png")}></img>
</div>
