Get information about a list of DIDs we interacted with.


```dart
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getDidProfileInfoList({
  required String did,
  required String privateKey,
  required List<FilterEntity>? filters,
});
```

`did` is the DID we interactedd with.

The `privateKey` is the key used to access all the sensitive information from the identity and also to realize operations like generating proofs.
